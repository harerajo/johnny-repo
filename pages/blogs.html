    <p> Most schools in Wales have been forced to close as the area prepares to be battered by Eunice.

      Cardiff, Ceredigion, Bridgend County, Swansea, Powys and Rhondda Cynon Taf councils said all schools will remain
      shut -
      and some schools in Newport will also be closed to pupils.

      Dozens of schools in Gwynedd, Conwy, Denbighshire, Flintshire and Wrexham will also be shut and schools in
      Anglesey,
      North Wales will also remain closed.

      Rob Stewart, leader of City and County of Swansea Council, has warned the storm a "really dangerous situation" as
      schools in the area close for 36,000 pupils.

      r Stewart said the decision to have pupils attend lessons remotely was made on Thursday as the area readies for
      extreme
      weather </p>
    <p>
      He told Sky News: "I mean it is, unfortunately, a combination that we are dealing with of heavy rain over the last
      few
      days which has swelled the rivers, we've got high tides at the moment and, of course, this very, very rare
      red-rated
      storm so we're as prepared as we can be but it is looking very dangerous for the next few hours."

      He added: "We've given safety messages and, again, I would repeat those.

      "If people are choosing to venture out today, stay away from our coastal lines, stay away from our rivers, do not
      put
      yourself in danger, stay at home if you can and work from home if you can so, you know, this is a really dangerous
      situation."

      HAMPSHIRE
      A major incident has been declared by the Hampshire and Isle of Wight Local Resilience Forum ahead of severe

      pupils
      safe from the gale.

      Schools and nurseries in Portsmouth, Southampton, Winchester, Havant and Basingstoke have been closed.

      Police in Hampshire have warned people not to travel unless absolutely necessary.

      on stand-by to put well-rehearsed plans into place."

      Environment
